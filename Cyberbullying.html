        <p>
          Cyberbullying is bullying that takes place over digital devices like
          cell phones, computers, and tablets. Cyberbullying can occur through
          SMS, Text, and apps, or online in social media, forums, or gaming
          where people can view, participate in, or share content. Cyberbullying
          includes sending, posting, or sharing negative, harmful, false, or
          mean content about someone else. It can include sharing personal or
          private information about someone else causing embarrassment or
          humiliation. Some cyberbullying crosses the line into unlawful or
          criminal behavior.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the prevalence of social media and digital forums, comments,
          photos, posts, and content shared by individuals can often be viewed
          by strangers as well as acquaintances. The content an individual
          shares online – both their personal content as well as any negative,
          mean, or hurtful content – creates a kind of permanent public record
          of their views, activities, and behavior. This public record can be
          thought of as an online reputation, which may be accessible to
          schools, employers, colleges, clubs, and others who may be researching
          an individual now or in the future. Cyberbullying can harm the online
          reputations of everyone involved – not just the person being bullied,
          but those doing the bullying or participating in it. Cyberbullying has
          unique concerns in that it can be:</br> <strong>Persistent</strong> – Digital devices offer
          an ability to immediately and continuously communicate 24 hours a day,
          so it can be difficult for children experiencing cyberbullying to find
          relief.</br> <strong>Permanent</strong> – Most information communicated electronically is
          permanent and public, if not reported and removed. A negative online
          reputation, including for those who bully, can impact college
          admissions, employment, and other areas of life.</br> <strong>Hard to Notice</strong> –
          Because teachers and parents may not overhear or see cyberbullying
          taking place, it is harder to recognize.
        </p>
        <p>
			Although all states have laws requiring schools to respond to bullying,
			 many states do not include cyberbullying under these laws or specify the 
			 role schools should play in responding to bullying that takes place outside of school.
			  Schools may take action either as required by law, or with local or school policies that allow them to discipline or take other action.
			   Some states also have provisions to address bullying if it affects school performance.
			 You can learn about the laws and policies in each state, including if they cover cyberbullying.
